This site contains internal documentation for the Analytical Platform team.

If you are a Analytical Platform _user_, please see our [User Guidance](https://user-guidance.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/).

## Introduction

We are the Analytical Platform, a multidisciplinary team. Our job is twofold: keeping our current [Analytical Platform](https://user-guidance.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/) running, and developing the future of data and analysis within the organisation, [Data Platform](https://technical-documentation.data-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/).

We work closely with [Data Platform Labs](https://peoplefinder.service.gov.uk/teams/data-platform-data-platform-labs) to build the Data Platform.

## Our Mission

Offer frictionless access to data for exploitation and visualisation, to drive decision making.

## Who Are We?
