As a team, we regularly discuss and decide on our alliance, and document these openly and publicly.

Our alliance is as follows (in no particular order):

- Happy Chickens, Happy Eggs
- It is important for us to continuously learn and develop
- We are not afraid to take risks or try new things
- We agree as a team that it's ok to make mistakes
- We are a team that helps each other
- We encourage collaboration from each other
- We encourage feedback from each other
- We give kudos
- We have strong ideas that are loosely held
- We operate a blameless culture
- We call it out when we are not working to our agreed principles
- We will shout about our successes
- Our team is a safe space to raise our concerns and worries
- We will review our alliance when the team changes or every quarter, whichever is sooner
